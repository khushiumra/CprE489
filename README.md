CprE 489 - Computer Networking and Data Communications

This is a course where we learned about how a computer network operates, along with how packets are transmited, how packets are routed, and
how to handle network congestion. We also learned about the OSI reference model, the TCP/IP networking architecture, and the various protocols
at the physical, data link, network, and transport layers. While we learning about what sockets are and how to use them, we wrote programs
where we built simple client-server applications to understand the concepts of computer networking. 

This course consisted of 10 labs and 6 homework assignments, where we utilized our knowledge of the C programming language and a working
knowledge of the Linux operating system.

# The labs for this class were:

1) Lab 1 - Network Utility Programs
2) Lab 2 - TCP Sockets Programming 
3) Lab 3 - UDP Socekts Programming
4) Lab 4 - Introduction to Geni
5) Lab 5 - Error Recovery with Go-Back-N ARQ Protocol
